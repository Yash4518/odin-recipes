    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Boneless chicken</li>
        <li>Sour cream</li>
        <li>Chili powder</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Green chiles</li>
        <li>Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken into a large pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle; shred chicken with two forks.</li>
        <li>Combine sour cream, condensed soup, and chili powder in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, then turn off the heat and cover to keep warm.</li>
        <li>At the same time, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add shredded chicken, water, 1/2 of the green onions, green chiles, and taco seasoning; simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in lime juice, onion powder, and garlic powder; simmer for 10 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Stir 1 cup soup mixture into the skillet with the chicken. Spread remaining soup mixture over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish</li>
        <li>Fill each tortilla with 1/5 of the chicken mixture and about 5 tablespoons Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Roll tortillas around filling and place enchiladas, seam-side down, into the baking dish. Pour enchilada sauce over top and sprinkle with remaining Cheddar, remaining green onions, and olives.Roll tortillas around filling and place enchiladas, seam-side down, into the baking dish.
